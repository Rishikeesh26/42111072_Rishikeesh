          <p>Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kant≈ç region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. 
            Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.
             The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards (which formerly made up Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.</p>
